# Scope

## Definition

Software scope is a well-defined boundary, which encompasses all the activities
that are done to develop and deliver the software product.

The software scope clearly defines all functionalities and artifacts to be
delivered as a part of the software. The scope identifies what the product will
do and what it will not do, what the end product will contain and what it will
not contain.
